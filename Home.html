						Having served the local area in Odell, Illinois for over 15 years, we at K.W.S. Storage are certain that we can find
						a suitable storage unit for you to be able to store anything you need. With storage unit sizes starting at 10x6 at 60 square feet,
						ranging all the way up to nits sized 10x30 or 300 square feet, you will be able to store almost anything you need in a reasonable amount of space,
						whether you are looking to simply store some documents for the time being, or you wish to store away a boat that would otherwise be taking up
						a large amount of space at your house during the winters.
					</p>

						Our business is in an excellently convenient location, at 500 W. Prairie Street, right off of the exit ramp on I-55, allowing for easy access whether

						taking a day off just to make time to come to us. We are here to operate at your convenience.
					</p>
					<p>
